{"name":"Acrobot","tagline":"The new public version of the original acrobot","body":"AcroBot\r\n=======\r\nAcroBot is an IRC bot that expands a provided acronym or abbreviation, if available. It supports context tags (@tag_name) to distinguish between various usages, and to differentiate between like acronyms.\r\n\r\nThis is the upstream source of the original bot, conceived and written by someone@redhat.com whom I shall look up later, and upon which all future variations have been based.\r\n\r\nConfiguration\r\n=============\r\n\r\nAcrobot looks for the file named `acrobot.yaml` first in $HOME, then where AcroBot.rb was installed\r\n\r\nThe configuration values available are:\r\n\r\n- **nick**: The nickname AcroBot will use in-channel\r\n- **realname**: Expanded realname (usually used for instructions on how to get help)\r\n- **user**: The user AcroBot uses to connect to IRC\r\n- **server**: The IRC server to use\r\n- **channels**: List of channels to join. Format is `['#CHAN-1','#CHAN-2',...]`\r\n- **prefix**: Prefix for AcroBot to pay attention to (usually `/^!/` )\r\n\r\nAbbreviations File\r\n==================\r\n\r\nAcroBot uses several flat YAML files to store the abbreviations it has learned about.\r\nThese files live in `#{install_dir}/`.\r\nAbbreviations are initially saved to `draft.yaml` with an `@unchecked` tag. They are later reviewed and either verified, updated, or discarded. Different dictionary files are used to store different categories of abbreviations. I'm unclear on the history of this particular move.\r\n\r\nAcroBot must have **RW** access to `draft.yaml` and **R** access to all other dictionary files when running.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
